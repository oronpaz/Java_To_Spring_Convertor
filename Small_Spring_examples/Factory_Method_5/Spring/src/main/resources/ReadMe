Factory Method - Example 5

This example demonstrate spring factory method ability.
In the MainConfiguration file we create 4 beans- the encrypt factory, the encrypts.
Returned type is Encrypt to allow polymorphism between all kind of encrypts.
The factory created and get all king of the encrypts in the system.
Main class inside main method creating an appContext instance, preparing a test array (to be encrypt by the system encrypts).
Get with the appContext the three Encrypt beans.
Each one of them encrypt the array with his own encrypt method.
In the future, in case we will want to add more encrypts, it will be very easy, thanks to spring.
