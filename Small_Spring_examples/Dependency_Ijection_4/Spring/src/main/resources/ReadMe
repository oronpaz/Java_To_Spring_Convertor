Dependency Injection - Example 4

This example demonstrate how spring can help with handling Service with DB elements.
The MainConfiguration file is import beans from ProductsConfiguration file.
ProductConfiguration file creating ProductRepoImpl, ProductServiceImpl.
ProductServiceImpl injected with ProductRepoImpl obj.
The Main class inside main method creating appContext instance, get the service bean.
Here is the magic - without let the main know which method I used to implement my DB (ProductRepository) - I can get all the products fom the service.
In the future, in case I will want to change the way I managed my DB, I'll have to change just the way I implement ProductRepository class, but nothing will be change in the main class.
